# Summary

**Project Overview**

In this comprehensive data engineering project, we will build a robust and scalable data platform to analyze the characteristics and performance of a bikestore business. By leveraging modern data stack technologies, we will develop a streamlined data pipeline that ingests, processes, stores the bikestore data and back it up, enabling advanced analytics and informed decision-making.
